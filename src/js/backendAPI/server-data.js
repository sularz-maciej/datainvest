                     Since October launched a campaign to promote the system
                     Molber.com – the project prepared by UniCo Sp. z o.o. under the
                     Innovative Economy Operational Programme. Today the target group
                     are a small library. In a few months we will present the product
                     for medium and large libraries.
                 </p>
                 <h4>What is Moliber.com?</h4>
                 <p>
                     Moliber.com is the computer system enabling to efficiently
                     management the library while maintaining the standard MARC21.
                     This system was created with a vision to create a virtual ecosystem
                     linking libraries and the readers. This program is easy to use.
                     You only need a computer with Internet access to get to the system
                     and effectively manage any library. It was created in Cloud
                     Computing technology, called “Data Cloud”. We take care of
                     everything what is necessary to functioning of applications – from
                     the hardware through the operating system until the final product.
                     The user gets access to the finished site that supports the
                     library and use it in the cloud (by internet) without having to
                     worry about installation, maintenance and upgrades. So You do not
                     need to invest in the equipment to HR management – all data library
                     and computing power can be found in our server. In addition there
                     is a possibility of virtual collaboration with other libraries.
                 </p>
                 <h4>To whom the campaign is directed?</h4>
                 <p>
                     The campaign is aimed at small libraries – in school (municipal
                         or public) – open to innovative solutions which will improve
                         library management. It’s easy and effectively to administrate
                         a small collection of volumes using novel solutions.
                 </p>
                 <h4>The advantages of Moliber.com</h4>
                 <p>
                     Moliber.com is a Simple and intuitive system of library and
                     reading room management. With a few clicks we can borrow books,
                     impose penalties readers assign the books to other departments.
                     The ability to print a barcodes eliminates the problem of the lost
                     library cards. Access to bibliographic records identifies the volume
                     contained in the library. Also, data security and user library is
                     very important. All information are stored on our server. We take
                     care of them good protection from damage and unauthorized persons.
                     Thanks to this library can reduce the cost of maintaining and using
                     the system. This system is completely mobile. Readers have unlimited
                     access to library resources. Also the library has its own information
                     page and social networking which creates the image of library. The
                     main and the most important advantage is improving the work of librarian.
                 </p>
                 <h4>Campaign details</h4>
                 <p>
                     During the campaign we will try to reach a large number of
                     libraries. Our consultants will be contacted by phone with
                     librarians presenting the advantages of using the system Moliber.com.
                     Also we have prepared a brochure sent via e-mail to all interested.
                     Since October there is a demo version of the program that will
                     help to understand all the functions of the system. We held a
                     competition for the new libraries. The main prize is a high
                     quality office equipment.<br>
                     Enjoy to participate!
