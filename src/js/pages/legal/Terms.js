                    where the use of the Site would be contrary to applicable law
                    or regulation or would subject DI to any registration or
                    licensing requirement in such jurisdiction. Persons who wish

                    this classification. Such confirmation will be treated by DI

                    of these terms as applicable under the regulatory regime of
                    their country of residence.
