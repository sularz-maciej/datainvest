[datainvest.pl](http://datainvest.pl/) rewritten in [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

### Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with the [Data Invest Sp. z o.o. S.K.A.](http://datainvest.pl/) in any way, shape or form.

I have just used their exisitng website to simulate a task of rewriting a website into a SPA (Single Page App). This allowed me to try out a new framework I have not previously had any experience with - React.js

### Installation
1. Install app dependencies `npm install`
2. Build the app `webpack`
3. Start webpack-dev-server `npm run dev`
4. Open your favourite browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Conclusion
I fell in love with React.js it feels so natural and allows to achieve complex things easily and efficiently. At first I was put off by the concept of JSX (JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript) but after writing a first few components it actually felt awesome!

Although I would change the way I organised the code if I was to start it all over again it does allow to write very modular apps that are very clean in their structure.

### What is next?
For now I am abandoning this project as I feel like I have acquired enough experience thanks to it. It will definitely benefit me in the future.

Peace out!
